## About git

### The layout of git repository
My git repository layout is 'Public'. It refers to this file can be downloaded by every git user. If I share this repository to the others, such as classmates and tutor, they can share their changes to the public repository. Therefore, version control and Merge Conflicts are important for this project. I can go back to the old version to reduce error ,which cannot be fixed, or combine each changing.

### The approach version control
My version control system is provided by Git. Verison control system is using for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. In this project, it is helping me for bug tracking and task management. Based on the error message which does not happened before, I can make a contrast between the old version and the code which is typing. Moreover, Merge Conflicts is a useful function for error checking after I push and pull the local file. When Merge Conflicts is happenning, I can chose which version to keep (HEAD or BRANCH) or modify the code to include what is required then remove any unwanted code to make sure the code is correct.
